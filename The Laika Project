Laika was the bravest dog astronaut that never made back to Earth alive.
With the support of the inventors of the Time Machine who decide to stay anonymous,
We have sent into the past, two agents to save Laika and bring her back to the present.
The very same Laika has been since, enhanced with our technology to be able to 
communicate and she has surpass the intelligence and skills of her fellow astronauts team members.
When a series of unpredictable reactions started to be associated with the Martial Eclipse,
Laika volunteered to be sent to the future and learn more about it, readily to give her life up 
once more for the sake of humanity.
